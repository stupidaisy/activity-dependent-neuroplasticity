# Modeling Activity-Dependent Neuroplasticity Under Variable Sensory Input

## Overview
This project investigates how varying patterns of sensory input influence activity-dependent neuroplasticity using a simplified computational model.

## Research Question
How do changes in sensory input frequency and intensity affect synaptic plasticity dynamics?

## Methodology
- Rate-based neural model
- Activity-dependent plasticity rule
- Simulated sensory input patterns
- Analysis of synaptic weight dynamics

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Status
Ongoing independent research project. Preprint will be uploaded to OSF.
